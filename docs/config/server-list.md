# Server List

Configure how your server appears in Minecraft's server list with these settings.

## Max Players

Maximum player count shown in server lists.
This setting controls how many players your server claims to support in the server list.
When `[lobby].enabled = true`, it also caps the number of players allowed in the lobby. Set `max_players = 0` to disable the lobby player limit.

:::code-group
```toml [server.toml] {2}
[server_list]
max_players = 20
```
:::

## Message of the Day

Message of the Day displayed in server lists.
The `message_of_the_day` appears in the server list and supports [MiniMessage formatting](/customization/message-formatting.html) for colors and styling.

:::code-group
```toml [server.toml] {2}
[server_list]
message_of_the_day = "<gold>A <bold>PicoLimbo</bold> Server</gold>"
```
:::

You can also use legacy color codes for backward compatibility:

:::code-group
```toml [server.toml] {2}
[server_list]
message_of_the_day = "§6A Minecraft Server"
```
:::

## Online Player Count

Show actual online player count in server lists.
When `show_online_player_count` is set to `true`, the server will display the actual number of currently connected players in the server list. If set to `false`, it will always show 0.

:::code-group
```toml [server.toml] {2}
[server_list]
show_online_player_count = true
```
:::

## Server Icon

Custom icon displayed in server list.

:::code-group
```toml [server.toml] {2}
[server_list]
server_icon = "server-icon.png"
```
:::

The default value is `"server-icon.png"`. If the specified file does not exist, the server will simply not send an icon to the client. The image must be a PNG file with dimensions of exactly 64x64 pixels.

To disable the server icon entirely:

:::code-group
```toml [server.toml] {2}
[server_list]
server_icon = ""
```
:::

## Reply to Status

Whether the server replies to status requests.

:::code-group
```toml [server.toml] {2}
[server_list]
reply_to_status = true
```

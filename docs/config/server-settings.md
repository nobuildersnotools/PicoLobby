# Server Settings

Representing `server.toml`

## Server Address

The address to bind the server to.

:::code-group
```toml [server.toml]
bind = "0.0.0.0:25565"
```
:::

## Welcome Message

Welcome message displayed to players after joining.
Supports [MiniMessage formatting](/customization/message-formatting.html) for colors and styling.

:::code-group
```toml [server.toml]
welcome_message = "<green>Welcome to <bold>PicoLimbo</bold>!</green>"
```
:::

You can also use legacy color codes for backward compatibility:

:::code-group
```toml [server.toml]
welcome_message = "§aWelcome to PicoLimbo!"
```
:::

Welcome message can be disabled by setting an empty string:

:::code-group
```toml [server.toml]
welcome_message = ""
```

## Lobby Join/Leave Messages

Lobby join and leave messages are broadcast to lobby players when `[lobby].enabled = true`.
They support [MiniMessage formatting](/customization/message-formatting.html) and the `{player}` placeholder.

:::code-group
```toml [server.toml]
[lobby]
join_message = "<yellow>{player} joined the game</yellow>"
leave_message = "<yellow>{player} left the game</yellow>"
```
:::

Either message can be disabled by setting it to an empty string:

:::code-group
```toml [server.toml]
[lobby]
join_message = ""
leave_message = ""
```
:::

## Action Bar <Badge type="warning" text="1.8+" />

Action bar message is displayed to players after joining above the hotbar.
Supports [MiniMessage formatting](/customization/message-formatting.html) for colors and styling.
Please note that for versions prior to 1.11, the action bar message will be sent using legacy color codes.

:::code-group
```toml [server.toml]
action_bar = "<green>Welcome to <bold>PicoLimbo</bold>!</green>"
```
:::

You can also use legacy color codes for backward compatibility:

:::code-group
```toml [server.toml]
action_bar = "§aWelcome to PicoLimbo!"
```
:::

Action bar message can be disabled by setting an empty string:

:::code-group

## Default Gamemode

The default game mode for players.

```
:::

Possible values:
```
survival
creative
adventure

> [!NOTE]
> For Minecraft versions 1.7.x, the spectator game mode does not exist. If you set `default_game_mode = "spectator"`, it will spawn players in "creative" mode instead.

hardcore = true
```

:::code-group
```toml [server.toml]

```
